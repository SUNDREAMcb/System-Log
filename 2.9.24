Today on my Python Learning Journey, i've tested myself on the basics of Python Syntax. This was developed through ChatGPT and compounded using e-books, youtube videos and advice of friends. 

Here is the overall journey i'll be taking on. 
    Basic Syntax:
        Spend at least 1-2 hours reviewing the basic syntax of Python. Understand how to define variables, use different data types (integers, floats, strings), and print output.

    Control Flow:
        Devote 2-3 hours to understanding control flow structures like if statements, loops (for and while loops), and how to use them to control the flow of your program.

    Functions:
        Allocate 2-3 hours to learn about functions. Understand how to define functions, pass arguments, and return values. Also, explore the concept of scope.

    Data Structures:
        Spend 2-3 hours on fundamental data structures like lists and dictionaries. Learn how to manipulate these structures and understand their methods.

    File Handling:
        Spend 1-2 hours on basic file handling. Learn how to open, read, and write to files.

    Exception Handling:
        Dedicate 1-2 hours to understanding exception handling. Learn about try, except blocks and how to handle errors in your code gracefully.

    Basic Libraries (Optional):
        If you have time and are comfortable with the above concepts, you can spend some time exploring basic libraries like random or math to perform simple operations.

The date is 2.9.24 and i feel very comfortable with Basic syntax. I also feel somewhat comfortable with Control Flow, but i need some more practice with advanced/nested control flow before i'm ready to move on to functions.
